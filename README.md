# Unity Automated Semver
 Github Action to increment relevant project settings "version" numbers per semantic versioning.



## Inputs

This is the data that you must set up in your own workflow file to use this action properly.

### semver-update-type

When calling this action, you can specify the type of semver update you'd like to perform. Suitable values are:

* major - This increments the first number in a "major.minor.patch" version string
* minor - This increments the second number in a "major.minor.patch" version string
* patch - This increments the third number in a "major.minor.patch" version string

### project-settings-path (optional)

The path to the ProjectSettings/ProjectSettings.asset file for your unity project. If not specified will action will attempt to automatically find it.

### should-add-ms-store-trailing-zero (optional)

If you're working with a platform that requires an extra trailing ".0" on a semver string, such as the Microsoft Store, you can set this to `"true"` (a string of the word "true") and your semver output will gain a 4th number.

So if this is set to false:

```
major.minor.patch
0.0.0
```

If this is set to true:

```
major.minor.patch.trailingZero
0.0.0.0
```

## Outputs 

This is the data that you can use after this action has completed, in other actions & scripts.

### semver-number 

This represents the semantic version string _after_ this action has been performed - it will reflect the new, updated version string.



## Example Usage

In your repository containing a Unity project, you should have a Github Actions workflow file set up in your `.github/workflows` directory. Name it whatever you want (as long as it ends in ".yml"!). After letting this action run, you then have to sort out committing & pushing the changed file(s) to your repo from within the workflow. The example code below shows all of this; it updates the patch number in every push made to the repository. 

Currently, the big downside to this process is that all developers working on the repo must then fetch & pull the changes made by this action. No one should be editing the `ProjectSettings.asset` file anyway so this shouldn't cause any merge or pull/push issues, but still worth noting.

```yaml
name: Update Unity project semantic versioning

on: [push]

jobs:
  create:
    name: Update semver
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      # You must ALWAYS checkout your repo so that actions in the workflow can use it.
      - name: Checkout 
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Find ProjectSettings.asset & increment its bundleVersion number
        uses: AlexStormwood/UnityAutomatedSemver@v1.1.0 # Change v1.1.1 to whatever tag is newer in the AlexStormwood/UnityAutomatedSemver repository.
        id: semver-update
        with:
          semver-update-type: 'patch' # Change this string to any suitable string mentioned in the Inputs section of this action's readme to suit your needs.
          project-settings-path: 'ProjectSettings/ProjectSettings.asset' # optional: specify the exact location of the ProjectSettings file, otherwise action will attempt to automatically find it.

      # Validate that the number has been incremented correctly.
      - name: Get the new semver number
        run: echo "The new semver number for this Unity project is ${{ steps.semver-update.outputs.semver-number }}"

      # Commit & push the updated semver number back into the repo. Yes, you have to fetch & pull in your local workstation after this step is done.
      - name: Push changed files back to repo
        uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4
        with:
          commit_message: "Updated semver via automated action."
          commit_options: '--no-verify --signoff'
```

## To-Do List

* General code optimizations
* Double-check & implement support for non-standard Unity target platforms (in case not all target platforms respect the bundleVersion property)
* Create more example workflows
